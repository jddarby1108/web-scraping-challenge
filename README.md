# web-scraping-challenge
This is the repository for homework due on Thursday October 29th.


I am out of time on turning this and late. :(
I tried very hard to figure out how to loop through the hemisphere images.
    I thought a 'for' loop would go through all the  classes
    I also tried to do some click link items like on the scrape books example to no avail!! depricated...
    This section is where I wasted most of my time, not truly wasted because I did learn a lot through trial and error, but failed to meet the task.
I did the flask portion for our ETL project, so I think I have a pretty good handle on that.  I just simply ran out of time to tie all the loose ends together on variables and calls etc and getting the Mongo dictionaries loaded properly.
Dissappointed but still trucking, so there's that.

Enjoy a few things on this working properly.
